## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: Add your explanation

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: Add your explanation

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: Add your explanation

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
Adding additional features to a model often leads to an improvement in performance, primarily due to the increased amount of information and context those features provide to the model. Hereâ€™s how adding features can impact model performance, and why this typically results in better outcomes:

Increased Relevance and Information: Additional features can introduce new, relevant information that was not captured by the initial set of features. This can help the model to make more informed predictions. For example, in a real estate pricing model, adding features like proximity to public transport, crime rates, and school district quality can provide significant insights that impact housing prices. A model trained with limited features might develop biases based on the narrow dataset it was trained on. By adding more diverse and comprehensive features, these biases can be reduced as the model starts considering a wider range of factors.

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|?|?|?|?|
|add_features|?|?|?|?|
|hpo|?|?|?|?|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.
